# Booksmaxxing iOS - Project Overview

## üéØ Project Vision

**Booksmaxxing** is an innovative iOS application designed to help users truly master non-fiction books by breaking them down into core ideas and guiding them through progressive levels of understanding. Instead of passive reading, users actively engage with concepts through AI-generated prompts and receive personalized feedback from the "author's perspective."

## üèóÔ∏è Core Architecture

### Application Structure
- **Language:** Swift with SwiftUI for modern iOS development
- **Data Layer:** SwiftData for local persistence with CoreData backing
- **AI Integration:** OpenAI GPT-4.1 and GPT-4.1-mini for content generation and evaluation
- **Architecture Pattern:** MVVM with observable objects and service layers

## üß† Core Concept: The Learning Journey

### The 4-Level Mastery System
1. **Level 0 - Thought Dump**: Unfiltered, free-form thinking about the concept
2. **Level 1 - Use**: Practical application of the idea
3. **Level 2 - Think With**: Using the idea as a thinking tool for analysis
4. **Level 3 - Build With**: Creative and critical application to new contexts

### User Flow
1. **Book Input** ‚Üí User enters a book title (with optional author)
2. **Idea Extraction** ‚Üí AI breaks the book into 15-50 core teachable ideas
3. **Progressive Learning** ‚Üí User works through ideas level by level
4. **AI Evaluation** ‚Üí Each response gets scored with detailed feedback
5. **Mastery Tracking** ‚Üí Progress is saved and visualized

## üìä Data Models & Persistence

### Core Entities

#### Book Model
```swift
@Model class Book {
    var id: UUID
    var title: String
    var author: String?
    var bookNumber: Int        // Sequential numbering (1, 2, 3...)
    var createdAt: Date
    var lastAccessed: Date
    @Relationship var ideas: [Idea]
}
```

#### Idea Model
```swift
@Model class Idea {
    var id: String             // Book-specific format: "b1i1", "b2i3"
    var title: String          // e.g., "Anchoring Effect"
    var ideaDescription: String // Core explanation
    var bookTitle: String
    var depthTarget: Int       // Complexity level (1-5)
    var masteryLevel: Int      // Current mastery (0-3)
    var currentLevel: Int?     // Resume point
    @Relationship var responses: [UserResponse]
    @Relationship var progress: [Progress]
}
```

#### UserResponse Model
```swift
@Model class UserResponse {
    var id: UUID
    var ideaId: String         // Links to specific idea
    var level: Int
    var prompt: String         // Original question
    var response: String       // User's answer
    var evaluationData: Data?  // JSON-encoded evaluation results
