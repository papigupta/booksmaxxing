  "i1 | Systems Thinking \'97 Understanding the world as a set of interconnected systems, where elements interact to produce patterns and behaviors over time. | Foundation",\
  "i2 | Elements, Interconnections, and Purpose \'97 Recognizing that systems consist of elements (parts), interconnections (relationships), and purpose (function or goal), all of which define system behavior. | Foundation",\
  "i3 | Stocks and Flows \'97 Distinguishing between stocks (accumulations or resources) and flows (rates of change), which together determine the state and dynamics of a system. | Foundation",\
  "i4 | Feedback Loops \'97 Identifying reinforcing (positive) and balancing (negative) feedback loops that drive system behavior, stability, and change. | Foundation",\
  "i5 | Causal Loop Diagrams \'97 Using visual tools to map feedback loops and relationships, clarifying how variables influence each other within a system. | Building Block",\
  "i6 | Dynamic Behavior Over Time \'97 Observing how systems change and evolve, often producing non-linear and sometimes counterintuitive outcomes. | Building Block",\
  "i7 | Delays \'97 Recognizing that time lags between actions and their effects can cause instability, oscillations, or unintended consequences in systems. | Building Block",\
  "i8 | Leverage Points \'97 Identifying places within a system where a small shift can produce significant, lasting changes in system behavior. | Foundation",\
  "i9 | System Boundaries \'97 Defining what is inside and outside a system, understanding that boundaries are mental constructs that shape analysis and solutions. | Building Block",\
  "i10 | Policy Resistance \'97 Understanding how systems can resist change due to feedbacks and internal structure, often undermining well-intentioned interventions. | Building Block",\
  "i11 | System Archetypes \'97 Recognizing common patterns of system behavior (such as 'Limits to Growth' or 'Tragedy of the Commons') that recur across different contexts. | Building Block",\
  "i12 | Mental Models \'97 Becoming aware of the assumptions and simplifications we use to interpret systems, and how these influence our actions and understanding. | Building Block",\
  "i13 | Resilience, Self-Organization, and Hierarchy \'97 Appreciating the properties that enable systems to persist, adapt, and evolve, including their capacity for self-organization and hierarchical structure. | Building Block",\
  "i14 | Bounded Rationality \'97 Accepting that decision-makers operate with limited information and understanding, which can lead to suboptimal or unintended outcomes. | Enhancement",\
  "i15 | Traps and Opportunities \'97 Identifying common system traps (like drift to low performance or escalation) and strategies for escaping them or turning them into opportunities. | Building Block",\
  "i16 | Modeling and Simulation \'97 Using models to represent, test, and understand system behavior, while acknowledging their limitations and the importance of iteration. | Enhancement",\
  "i17 | The Importance of Humility and Learning \'97 Embracing uncertainty, learning from feedback, and being willing to adapt approaches as systems reveal new behaviors. | Enhancement",\
  "i18 | Seeing the Whole \'97 Shifting focus from individual parts to the behavior of the whole system, fostering holistic understanding and more effective interventions. | Foundation"\
