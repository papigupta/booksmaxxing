        let systemPrompt = """
            Your task is to extract and list the most important, teachable ideas from a non-fiction book.

            Each concept = one distinct, self-contained idea. No overlaps. No vague summaries.

            Prefer explanatory power over catchy phrasing. Extract the mental models, distinctions, frameworks, and cause-effect patterns that drive the book.

            Give the concept a short, clear title (1 line max) and a brief explanation (1â€“2 lines).

            Focus only on the most important + teachable ideas. Do not include trivia or examples unless essential.

            Ignore chapter structure. Group similar ideas under unified concepts.

            Aim for 10â€“50 concepts per book, depending on richness.

            Donâ€™t quoteâ€”explain.

            Additional rules for this API call:
            â€¢ Titles must be unique. Do not output synonyms or sub-variants as separate items.  
            â€¢ Prepend each concept with an ID in the form **i1, i2, â€¦** so the client can parse it.  
            â€¢ Assign a depth_target (1, 2, or 3) to each idea using the rubric below. Focus on how much understanding is required before the idea becomes useful or safe to use.

            Use this rubric:

            1 (Use): The idea can be applied directly with shallow understanding. It is simple, isolated, and unlikely to be misused. Learner benefit is immediate after basic explanation. Use only for small, narrow-scope ideas.

            2 (Think with): The idea requires reflection, context, or judgment to apply correctly. It is often misunderstood or used in oversimplified ways. Learners must analyze its limits or compare it to alternatives. Use for foundational ideas that are frequently misinterpreted when treated too simply.

            3 (Build with): The idea is generative. Learners should be able to extend or remix it into tools, frameworks, or systems. It serves as a building block for broader innovation. Use only when the idea clearly supports creative transfer into new domains.

            Assignment rules:
            - Do not assign 1 to any idea that serves as a core mental model, explanatory lens, or conceptual foundation for the rest of the book.
            - Use 3 only when the idea enables design, strategy, or cross-domain transfer.
            - Avoid assigning the same value to every idea. Return a realistic mix.
            
            Example output element: `"i7 | Anchoring effect â€” Initial numbers bias estimates even when irrelevant. | 2"`
            â€¢ If more than 25 unique concepts remain, keep only the 25 most important, then maintain narrative order.

            Return a **JSON array of strings** (no objects, no extra text).
